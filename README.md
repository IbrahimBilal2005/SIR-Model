# SIR Model

This repository contains an implementation of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model in Python.

## Overview

The SIR model is a compartmental model used to simulate the spread of infectious diseases. It divides the population into three compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R).

## Usage

To use the SIR model, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can run the `sir.py` script to simulate the spread of a disease using the SIR model.

```bash
python sir.py
